		<description><![CDATA[Dear Colleagues, The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is delighted by the campus response to the UIC DPI Seed Funding Program. This funding opportunity, as previously announced, leverages up to $10 million from UIC’s royalty revenue as “seed funds” to align new UIC research activities with the DPI mission and priorities. Information on DPI can be found at <a href="https://dpi.uillinois.edu/">https://dpi.uillinois.edu/.</a></p>
<p>Two cycles of funding were announced in October. Due to a strong response to Cycle 1 and a large volume of letter of intent (LOIs) submitted for Cycle 2, we are extending the deadline for Cycle 2 applications.</p>
<p><strong>DPI Seed Funding Cycle 2 proposals will be due no later than 5:00 pm Central Time on Friday, January 18, 2019.</strong></p>
<p>Please visit the DPI Seed Program page for additional information and FAQs at <a href="http://research.uic.edu/uicdpi">http://research.uic.edu/uicdpi</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Joanna Groden, Ph.D.<br />
Vice Chancellor for Research</p>

		<title>PHISHING/SCAM Alert: Gift Card Email Scam Targeting UIC Faculty and Staff</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The ACCC Information Security and Privacy Office has been receiving [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The ACCC Information Security and Privacy Office has been receiving many reports of directed email scams targeting UIC faculty and staff in an attempt to get the recipient to purchase gift cards and to email the gift card numbers to the attacker.</p>
<p>If you receive such a message, DO NOT RESPOND.</p>
<p>In these attacks, UIC faculty and staff are sent email pretending to be from university leaders, typically deans, directors, or department heads. The emails arrive from random email addresses that are sometimes crafted to trick the recipient at first glance but are not really from a UIC.EDU address. For example, the email may arrive from “bobgreen.uic.edu@gmail.com” or “bobgreen@xyz.com” but not from “bobgreen@uic.edu”. The name of the person sending the email is changed to the name of the university leader (e.g. “Bob Green”). Sometimes the sender is hoping that the recipient will not notice that the email is not from UIC but in other cases it has purported to be from the leader’s personal email account.</p>
<p>The end goal of the emails appears to be to convince unsuspecting staff to purchase gift cards on the “leader’s behalf” and email the codes to them with the promise of later reimbursement.</p>
<p>The email attacks that we have been seeing sometimes begin with an email such as “Are you available?” and if someone responds, the attacker posing as the leader explains that they are caught in a meeting, can’t take calls and need the recipient to buy gift cards for them and will reimburse them later.</p>
<p>Other attacks have had the “please buy gift cards for me” message included in the first wave.</p>
<p>Due to the use of random senders and the commonplace text in the emails of these attacks, ACCC is unable to prevent them without blocking legitimate email.</p>
<p>Again, if you receive such a message, do not respond. If you are in doubt, contact the person who is supposedly sending the email by campus phone before taking any action as directed.</p>
<p>If you received email of this form and purchased gift cards, please contact the UIC Police for assistance. For information on how to contact the UIC Police, please visit <a href="http://police.uic.edu">police.uic.edu</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Attackers have been targeting the UIC student community with emails [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Attackers have been targeting the UIC student community with emails advertising fake job opportunities. In particular, emails with the subject &#8220;Your UIC Job Application (Administrative Coordinating Assistant)&#8221; are part of a scam designed to trick students into sending money to the attackers.</p>
<p>In this type of scam, the attacker (email sender) requests the name, phone number, and postal/email addresses of people who respond to the email wanting to make extra cash. Once interest is expressed, the attacker follows-up with a phone call. The caller then proceeds to instruct the responder to deposit checks in their personal bank account. Once the check is deposited, the victim is instructed to purchase gift cards and send the card numbers of the associated gift cards to the listed email address.</p>
<p>This is a common scam in which the scam artists attempt to get a person to deposit a fraudulent check into their bank account, realizing that many banks will allow you to receive cash back before the usual 3 day processing period. After the 3 day processing period, the bank notifies the account holder that the check was fraudulent and the account holder loses funds and is often held responsible for re-payment of the amounts already sent to the attacker.</p>
<p>This particular scam was designed to appear as if it was a university sponsored job that required one hour a day, 3 days a week, paying $620 weekly.</p>
<p>For security reasons, we are not including the text of the email scam in this notice, but indicators that this email is a scam:<br />
• Unusually high pay<br />
• Employer is unable to meet in-person due to being out of the country<br />
• Poor spelling, grammar and punctuation<br />
• Dubious job activities: “help me Mail letters, Make payments at Walmart and purchase some Items when needed.”<br />
• Requests a reply with Full name, Residential Address, and personal email<br />
• Scrutinize the email address to see who sent it.</p>
<p>As always, individuals are advised to scrutinize unsolicited email for signs that it may be an attack or scam before replying with information or clicking on links.</p>
<p>If you received this email and responded with your information, please contact the UIC Police for assistance. For information on how to contact the UIC Police, please visit police.uic.edu.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Members of the UIC Community,</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the senseless violence that occurred yesterday at Mercy Hospital, the UIC community joins the City of Chicago and our colleagues at Mercy as we mourn the lives that were taken.</p>
<p>Among those who did not survive the attack was Dr. Tamara E. O’Neal, a member of the UIC family. Dr. O’Neal was a 2014 MD graduate and 2017 Emergency Medicine Resident graduate from the University of Illinois College of Medicine here in Chicago. Upon completing this training, Dr. O’Neal had been working in the emergency department at Mercy for two years, where she continued to teach some of our clinical residents in a volunteer capacity. Dr. O’Neal will be remembered for her infectious smile and her commitment to social justice, as she often raised money for disadvantaged children and led her church choir.</p>
<p>In addition to Dr. O’Neal’s death, others who will be mourned during this time include Chicago police officer, Samuel Jimenez, and a Mercy pharmacy resident, Dayna Less, who was participating in a UIC College of Pharmacy resident teaching program.</p>
<p>Gun violence is an epidemic that deeply affects the lives of families, neighbors, and communities in Chicago and across the nation. This is certainly not the first time it has touched our UIC community and we must continue working together to ensure that we take every possible measure to protect the safety of our students, faculty, researchers, staff and patients while on our campus.</p>
<p>As you gather together with your families this week, we hope that you will carry in your hearts the spirit of compassion, service and joy that characterized Dr. O’Neal throughout her short life. The best collective way to honor her memory is to remain steadfast in our commitment to building stronger communities through education and health care delivery for all.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing distress related to this event, please consider accessing the resources available to our campus community, including the <a href="https://counseling.uic.edu">UIC Counseling Center</a>, the <a href="https://www.hr.uillinois.edu/benefits/worklife/eap">Employee Assistance Program</a>, or the <a href="https://can.uic.edu">Campus Advocacy Network</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael D. Amiridis<br />
Chancellor</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear colleagues:</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, we wanted to share some of the remarkable progress we have made toward the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN) since the discussion forums at each of our universities earlier this fall.</p>
<p>We have formed the academic working groups that are helping develop DPI’s initial plans and priorities, and the 125 members from across the system who are sharing their talents have been added to our DPI website. We have begun DPI operations in our 20,000-square-foot facility at 200 South Wacker Drive in Chicago, where we are able to host research, education and outreach projects, events, courses, and meetings. We have officially applied for the $500 million in state capital funding that the legislature approved last spring to develop DPI and IIN, which includes the projects at our universities that we outlined at the discussion forums in August. And we have greatly improved our website, transitioning it from a concept site to one that reflects a living, active institute.</p>
<p>We have announced an IIN hub at Northern Illinois University, the first outside of the U of I System’s three universities. We also have had very positive conversations with every four-year public university in the state about becoming an IIN hub, and expect additional hub announcements.</p>
<p>As we continue our work, we hope many more of you will become involved. We invite you to join experts groups organized around DPI’s themes and cross-cutting areas, and to submit proposals for DPI research, education, and engagement activities. The experts groups will provide feedback to guide development of each theme and cross-cutting area. The proposals will produce the first wave of educational, research, and outreach activities at DPI and are eligible for up to $15,000 of seed funding per project.</p>
<p>The proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis beginning on Dec. 14. The expertise of our faculty and staff is a cornerstone of DPI and IIN, and we look forward to your creative proposals and your input through the experts groups.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you do for the U of I System.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tim Killeen<br />
President</p>
<p>Ed Seidel<br />
Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation</p>
<p>Bill Sanders<br />
Interim Director, Discovery Partners Institute</p>

<p>UIC coach Tasha Pointer knew facing Northwestern at Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston would be tough.</p>
<p>“Obviously, we wanted to win,” she said. “We didn’t give our best effort.”</p>
<p>The difficult road game Nov. 15 against the Wildcats was scheduled way before the former NU assistant coach left last season to coach the Flames.</p>
<p>Thursday night’s game was the first time Pointer had appeared at Welsh-Ryan as a head coach. And though UIC lost 87-44, she feels the matchup can have a positive impact.</p>
<p>“Northwestern came out and punched us first and we didn’t know how to respond,” Pointer told reporters after the game. “For UIC, we have to allow this game to drive us to be better.”</p>
<p>NU coach Joe McKeown praised Pointer’s performance.</p>
<p>“I just think great things are ahead for her at UIC,” he said. “They made a commitment to women’s basketball when they hired her last spring. I think you’re going to see that over the next couple of years.”</p>
<p>Pointer is confident the Flames will bounce back.</p>
<p>“First of all,  Coach McKeown is a phenomenal coach. One of the things that I learned from him was — no matter what — run your stuff and have great expectations of your team and have your team execute,” she said.</p>
<p>Pointer had hoped for a more triumphant homecoming after beating Valparaiso 75-65 on Nov. 7.</p>
<p>“Coming into the (NU) game I was just conflicted,” she said. “Who wants to lose to their former team and, for that matter, any team?”</p>
<p>Anytime you take over a program that hasn’t been as successful, “you have to appreciate these moments and in between because they are teaching moments,” Pointer said.</p>
<p>“Moving forward, for us at UIC, it is allowing moments like this to help elevate our mentality, our culture and really transform the program,” she said.</p>

<p>More than 300 people — kids with cancer or sickle cell disease and their families — celebrated the holidays at UIC Nov. 17. The event, which was hosted by the pediatric hematology/oncology department of the Children&#8217;s Hospital University of Illinois, included a Thanksgiving-inspired meal, holiday crafts, dancing and a gift exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today is not about being a doctor or a patient,&#8221; said Dr. Mary Lou Schmidt, professor of pediatrics and head of pediatric hematology and oncology. &#8220;It&#8217;s about having fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volunteers from the Girl Scouts, A Silver Lining, Bear Necessities and others helped kids use paint, paper, beads and a host of other materials to make holiday crafts. Students from the UIC College of Dentistry dressed up as tooth fairies and as &#8220;Mr. Molar,&#8221; encouraging kids to practice good brushing habits with a novelty-sized toothbrush and stuffed animals. Dunkin&#8217; Donuts provided supplies so kids could decorate their donuts, and eat their dessert before lunch if desired. The Joffrey Ballet’s Exelon Strobel Dancers danced for and with attendees, young and old.</p>
<p>For Kelly, mom of an 18-month-old with leukemia, the event was also a celebration of her daughter&#8217;s progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kathryn was diagnosed one year ago today,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At this time last year, we were in the hospital. To see her running around today, healthy, means everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event was also meaningful to Kelly because two of Kathryn&#8217;s three siblings were also there, along with their dad and Kelly&#8217;s husband, Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to spend so much time apart,&#8221; said Kelly, who spent more than 190 days in the hospital last year with her daughter. &#8220;Finding time to be together means everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schmidt says the event is about relationships and celebration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cancer or sickle cell and a number of other conditions have touched everyone in this room, but we have so much to celebrate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have so many wonderful stories to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Javontae, 24, a Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma survivor, attended the event with his mom, sister, friend and a few cousins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love being here with my family,&#8221; said Javontae, who has been in remission for eight years. He said that while most of the activities are for younger kids, he still has a good time, especially with his younger family members.</p>
<p>Supporting the event were more than 50 UIC volunteers, primarily from the College of Medicine, and 10 organizations, including Flashes of Hope, Gilda&#8217;s Club, Holiday Heroes, Ladies Philoptochos Society and North Star Reach.</p>

<p>As the months grow colder and the night comes sooner, the school days are getting more difficult to endure for me. Living close to campus, spending the whole week walking the same paths, taking the same buses, and longingly gazing at the towering skyline from the same vantage point, I start to feel trapped. I start to forget that I live in one of the most brilliant cities on this planet.</p>
<p>That is why I was so excited to hear in one of my classes about the new exhibit open this winter at the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;entry=s&amp;sa=X&amp;ftid=0x880e28fcf5c75bdb:0x26c50174d0fc68ed&amp;gmm=CgIgAQ%3D%3D">Stony Island Arts Bank</a> on the South Side. In honor of the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Chicago’s chapter of the Black Panther Party, the “ICONIC: BLACK PANTHER,” exhibit features rooms of art from local artists, as well as renowned artists from the movement like Emory Douglas.</p>
<p>I had never before heard of the Stony Island Arts Bank, and I can’t believe I have lived in the city for two years without experiencing it. The building, converted from an old bank on Stony Island Avenue, is now a vibrant space filled with art, media and literature on the second floor. It was renovated ultimately to engage in rich South Side history. The art in the exhibit was powerful and thoughtful, and it reminds me of the dense history that exists in our city. To be mindful of the struggle and resistance against racist policy and oppressed blacks, Latinx, and virtually every minority who has lived in this city, I believe is incredibly vital to learning how to be self-aware in an urban space.</p>
<p>There is so much to learn and appreciate about Chicago, and a great way of starting to do that is through engaging and supporting the art produced by local artists. There is so much more value to a piece than an “aesthetic” for a profile picture; ask questions, dig deeper, find out the context, history, and the background of the artist. I promise you will get so much more out of it. Visit the Stony Island Arts Bank and tell others about it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The University of Illinois at Chicago has received a $500,000, five-year grant from the National Science Foundation to support the Center for Advanced Design and Manufacturing of Integrated Microfluidics.</p>
<p>The center, also known by its initials CADMIM, has two sites — one at UIC and another at the University of California, Irvine — and focuses on developing miniature devices that can perform biochemical analytical functions quickly and cheaply. These devices can be used to do things like rapidly detect dangerous toxins in the blood, quickly screen hundreds of potential drugs, isolate cells for in cancer diagnostics and treatment, or provide information on plant health that can be used to improve crop outputs.</p>
<div id="attachment_71153" style="width: 397px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads.jpg"><img class="wp-image-71153 size-medium" src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads-387x258.jpg" alt="CADMIM leads" width="387" height="258" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads-768x512.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/CADMIMleads-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The core CADMIM team: Gisela Lin and Abe Lee of UC Irvine and Ian Papautsky (right) of UIC.</p></div>
<p>The UIC site has expertise in microfluidics, cell separations, 3D printing and point-of-care sensors, as well as in creating tiny living model &#8220;organ-on-a-chip&#8221; systems.</p>
<p>The total funding for the two-site center is $1.25 million, and is a second phase of investment in the CADMIM, which launched five years ago with a $836,000 grant from the NSF.</p>
<p>“In the last five years, CADMIM researchers have worked with industry leaders to provide customized solutions using advanced microfluidics technology,” said Ian Papautsky, the Richard and Loan Hill Professor of Bioengineering in the UIC College of Engineering and leader of the UIC CADMIM site. “We look forward to bringing more industry partners on board, working with them to advance microfluidics technology and develop solutions to their needs, and also to providing unique internship opportunities to our grad students through these partnerships.”</p>
<p>“It is gratifying to know that the National Science Foundation is recognizing and rewarding the many accomplishments of CADMIM in the first five years, in research, in technology transfer, and most importantly, in building a community of students, faculty and industrial members that bridges advanced research with real-world applications,” said Abe Lee, the William J. Link Professor and chair of biomedical engineering at UC Irvine and its CADMIM director.</p>
<p>CADMIM is funded through the NSF’s Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers program, which fosters long-term partnerships among academia, industry and government in various technology sectors. The center has worked with several industry leaders over the last five years, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Beckman Coulter, KWS, Monsanto, QIAGEN,  ThermoFisher Scientific, Canon U.S. Life Sciences, GSK, Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, Douglas Scientific, Amgen Inc., Genentech Inc., Corning Inc., Los Alamos National Laboratories and Air Force Research Labs.</p>
<p>CADMIM industry partners provide funding for university researchers to develop solutions for specific needs or problems.</p>
<p>UIC and UC Irvine CADMIM researchers working with GSK, are developing a human liver culture platform using induced pluripotent stem cell technology that can be used to screen thousands of compounds in early drug discovery using a sustainable and genetically-diverse source of patient-specific cells.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, this platform can be used to mitigate the risk of drug toxicity to patients in the clinic, as well as develop novel therapeutics against global human liver diseases such as hepatitis B viral infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma,” said Salman Khetani, associate professor of bioengineering at UIC and a lead researcher on the liver project.</p>
<p>In another project, working with KWS, a German company focused on plant breeding, UIC CADMIM researchers are creating sensors that would be &#8220;worn&#8221; by plants to provide information on plant hydration and fertilization.</p>
<p>“This sensor was created so that growers could get a better handle on the health of their plants so they could make informed adjustments to watering or nutrition for better crop yield,” Papautsky said. Other UIC projects have produced point-of-care sensors that can help health care providers quickly determine blood lead and manganese levels in the field and &#8220;micro livers&#8221; that can be used to test drug toxicity before clinical trials in humans.</p>
<p>David Eddington and Jie Xu from the University of Illinois at Chicago and Elliot Hui, Jered Haun, Michelle Khine and Michelle Digman from UC Irvine, are other key researchers in CADMIM.</p>

<p>Make an impact at UIC during IGNITE GivingTuesday on Nov. 27 — a day that aims to unify the campus community under the act of giving back.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the global giving holiday on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, UIC’s participating in GivingTuesday encourages the campus community to celebrate how broad participating can make a difference. For more information or to donate, visit <a href="http://givingtuesday.uic.edu"><em>givingtuesday.uic.edu</em></a></p>
<p>“This is a way for the entire UIC campus, along with alumni and friends, to come together with a common goal of encouraging participation and raising as much as we can to help support UIC faculty, students and everyone in the UIC community,” said Meredith Howell, executive director of participation in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Advancement. “The best thing about this initiative is that it truly does make a tremendous impact. We all come together, and it’s so inspiring.”</p>
<p>Last year, IGNITE GivingTuesday raised more than $117,000 from about 700 donors.</p>
<p>IGNITE GivingTuesday is part of a larger fundraising campaign on campus, called “IGNITE: The Campaign for UIC,” which launched last fall. The campaign’s goal is to raise $750 million over five years to forge the future of education by redefining the student experience, empowering faculty, driving discovery and connecting to communities.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 15, the campaign has raised more than $360 million — 48 percent of its goal.</p>
<p>“The IGNITE campaign aims to raise funds for student scholarships, endowed faculty positions, research and teaching technologies and improved campus facilities,” Howell said. “We are all invested in making a tremendous impact at UIC.”</p>
