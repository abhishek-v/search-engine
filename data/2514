				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The ARABAMCC is hosting two events next week. Please share with your students:</em></p>
<p><strong>Mental Health Stigma in Arab &amp; Muslim Communities</strong></p>
<p>How do we deal with mental health stigma in Arab and Muslim Communities and seek help?</p>
<p>While mental health stigma exists in most socities and cultures including the U.S. culture, Arab and Muslim communities might face unique challenges with regard to seeking mental health services. The stereotypes, prejudice, public stigma, and discrimination that target Arab and Muslim Communities could create barriers to seeking help. Through coming together, sharing ideas, and engaging in activities we hope to break the silence and talk about mental health issues and stigma in Arab and Muslim Communities. We will discuss culturally specific presentations of mental health problems in Arab and Muslim Communities and ways to find help.</p>
<p>Arab American Cultural Center<br />
November 27, 2018<br />
12:00 p.m. &#8211; 2:00 p.m.<br />
111 Stevenson Hall</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>A community discussion on racial profiling of Arab &amp; Muslim communities</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered if you are under surveillance?</p>
<p>Join us in an interactive event with the Arab American Action Network&#8217;s youth program where youth leaders will discuss how surveillance impacts our communities. This is an educational event about how anti-Arab and anti-Muslim racism operates through rhetoric and state and local policies related to &#8220;national security&#8221; and how Arabs &amp; Muslims in schools and on college campuses navigate the realities of racial profiling and surveillance in Chicagoland. This event will provide students with the opportunity to share experiences and ideas and to learn about important constitutional protections, including the First and Fourth Amendment rights as well as how these rights are currently under threat and waht civil rights advocates are doing about it.</p>
<p>The event is free and geared towards people impacted by anti-Arab/anti-Muslim racism and surveillance.<br />
Food will be provided. Accessible by wheelchair. For more accessibility, email arabamcc@uic.edu.</p>

<p>The Bachelor of Design (BDes) program prepares students for professional careers in a variety of disciplines that constitute contemporary practice. Through structured practical and theoretical exercises, the program seeks to develop in its students a broad visual vocabulary and wide range of analytical, organizational, and technical skills that focus on design processes, research, materials and methods for a wide range of design applications. Students experience a unique learning opportunity that takes advantage of the University’s interdisciplinary programs in a dynamic urban center.</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Design teaches skills and methods from graphic design, industrial design, design history and theory, and design research within the context of a research university in order to foster exploration across the sciences and humanities. This BA is ideal for students looking to study widely across the university while earning a foundational education in the material methods and practices of design as well as those looking to earn a second degree that will complement an education in the liberal arts and sciences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Academic Advisors,</p>
<p>Hope this email finds you well!</p>
<p>Your thoughts and input are needed regarding a new initiative out of the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs (OVPFA).</p>
<p>A few years ago, UIC’s Student Government requested that an official resource be developed that shared results from the Student Evaluation of Teaching Program or Course Evaluations. This resource would serve a similar function as the “Rate My Professor” website yet service only UIC users and include a standardized set of questions.</p>
<p>As a response, OVPFA and ACCC teamed up to develop a website that publishes results for all courses using the same 5 survey items with the <strong><em>exception</em></strong> of the following courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to FERPA laws, no instructors who are also enrolled as students at UIC will be published (e.g. TA’s, adjunct, etc.)</li>
<li>Any course with less than 10 respondents</li>
</ul>
<p>At your earliest convenience, please take a look at the website and let me know your thoughts and suggestions for how to frame this resource to the students. Please provide feedback no later than Tuesday November 27<sup>th</sup>.  Our aim is to have the website shared with the students on <strong>Thursday December 13<sup>th</sup></strong> (after the Fall 2018 course evaluation period closes).</p>
<p>When accessing the site, you will need to enter your UIC netid and password.</p>
<p><a href="https://courseevaluations.uic.edu/">https://courseevaluations.uic.edu/</a></p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and attention!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Kim</p>

Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs</p>
