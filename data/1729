				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is delighted by the campus response to the UIC DPI Seed Funding Program. This funding opportunity, as previously announced, leverages up to $10 million from UIC’s royalty revenue as “seed funds” to align new UIC research activities with the DPI mission and priorities. Information on DPI can be found at <a href="https://dpi.uillinois.edu/">https://dpi.uillinois.edu/.</a></p>
<p>Two cycles of funding were announced in October. Due to a strong response to Cycle 1 and a large volume of letter of intent (LOIs) submitted for Cycle 2, we are extending the deadline for Cycle 2 applications.</p>
<p><strong>DPI Seed Funding Cycle 2 proposals will be due no later than 5:00 pm Central Time on Friday, January 18, 2019.</strong></p>
<p>Please visit the DPI Seed Program page for additional information and FAQs at <a href="http://research.uic.edu/uicdpi">http://research.uic.edu/uicdpi</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Joanna Groden, Ph.D.<br />
Vice Chancellor for Research</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The ACCC Information Security and Privacy Office has been receiving [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The ACCC Information Security and Privacy Office has been receiving many reports of directed email scams targeting UIC faculty and staff in an attempt to get the recipient to purchase gift cards and to email the gift card numbers to the attacker.</p>
<p>If you receive such a message, DO NOT RESPOND.</p>
<p>In these attacks, UIC faculty and staff are sent email pretending to be from university leaders, typically deans, directors, or department heads. The emails arrive from random email addresses that are sometimes crafted to trick the recipient at first glance but are not really from a UIC.EDU address. For example, the email may arrive from “bobgreen.uic.edu@gmail.com” or “bobgreen@xyz.com” but not from “bobgreen@uic.edu”. The name of the person sending the email is changed to the name of the university leader (e.g. “Bob Green”). Sometimes the sender is hoping that the recipient will not notice that the email is not from UIC but in other cases it has purported to be from the leader’s personal email account.</p>
<p>The end goal of the emails appears to be to convince unsuspecting staff to purchase gift cards on the “leader’s behalf” and email the codes to them with the promise of later reimbursement.</p>
<p>The email attacks that we have been seeing sometimes begin with an email such as “Are you available?” and if someone responds, the attacker posing as the leader explains that they are caught in a meeting, can’t take calls and need the recipient to buy gift cards for them and will reimburse them later.</p>
<p>Other attacks have had the “please buy gift cards for me” message included in the first wave.</p>
<p>Due to the use of random senders and the commonplace text in the emails of these attacks, ACCC is unable to prevent them without blocking legitimate email.</p>
<p>Again, if you receive such a message, do not respond. If you are in doubt, contact the person who is supposedly sending the email by campus phone before taking any action as directed.</p>
<p>If you received email of this form and purchased gift cards, please contact the UIC Police for assistance. For information on how to contact the UIC Police, please visit <a href="http://police.uic.edu">police.uic.edu</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Attackers have been targeting the UIC student community with emails [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Attackers have been targeting the UIC student community with emails advertising fake job opportunities. In particular, emails with the subject &#8220;Your UIC Job Application (Administrative Coordinating Assistant)&#8221; are part of a scam designed to trick students into sending money to the attackers.</p>
<p>In this type of scam, the attacker (email sender) requests the name, phone number, and postal/email addresses of people who respond to the email wanting to make extra cash. Once interest is expressed, the attacker follows-up with a phone call. The caller then proceeds to instruct the responder to deposit checks in their personal bank account. Once the check is deposited, the victim is instructed to purchase gift cards and send the card numbers of the associated gift cards to the listed email address.</p>
<p>This is a common scam in which the scam artists attempt to get a person to deposit a fraudulent check into their bank account, realizing that many banks will allow you to receive cash back before the usual 3 day processing period. After the 3 day processing period, the bank notifies the account holder that the check was fraudulent and the account holder loses funds and is often held responsible for re-payment of the amounts already sent to the attacker.</p>
<p>This particular scam was designed to appear as if it was a university sponsored job that required one hour a day, 3 days a week, paying $620 weekly.</p>
<p>For security reasons, we are not including the text of the email scam in this notice, but indicators that this email is a scam:<br />
• Unusually high pay<br />
• Employer is unable to meet in-person due to being out of the country<br />
• Poor spelling, grammar and punctuation<br />
• Dubious job activities: “help me Mail letters, Make payments at Walmart and purchase some Items when needed.”<br />
• Requests a reply with Full name, Residential Address, and personal email<br />
• Scrutinize the email address to see who sent it.</p>
<p>As always, individuals are advised to scrutinize unsolicited email for signs that it may be an attack or scam before replying with information or clicking on links.</p>
<p>If you received this email and responded with your information, please contact the UIC Police for assistance. For information on how to contact the UIC Police, please visit police.uic.edu.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Members of the UIC Community,</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the senseless violence that occurred yesterday at Mercy Hospital, the UIC community joins the City of Chicago and our colleagues at Mercy as we mourn the lives that were taken.</p>
<p>Among those who did not survive the attack was Dr. Tamara E. O’Neal, a member of the UIC family. Dr. O’Neal was a 2014 MD graduate and 2017 Emergency Medicine Resident graduate from the University of Illinois College of Medicine here in Chicago. Upon completing this training, Dr. O’Neal had been working in the emergency department at Mercy for two years, where she continued to teach some of our clinical residents in a volunteer capacity. Dr. O’Neal will be remembered for her infectious smile and her commitment to social justice, as she often raised money for disadvantaged children and led her church choir.</p>
<p>In addition to Dr. O’Neal’s death, others who will be mourned during this time include Chicago police officer, Samuel Jimenez, and a Mercy pharmacy resident, Dayna Less, who was participating in a UIC College of Pharmacy resident teaching program.</p>
<p>Gun violence is an epidemic that deeply affects the lives of families, neighbors, and communities in Chicago and across the nation. This is certainly not the first time it has touched our UIC community and we must continue working together to ensure that we take every possible measure to protect the safety of our students, faculty, researchers, staff and patients while on our campus.</p>
<p>As you gather together with your families this week, we hope that you will carry in your hearts the spirit of compassion, service and joy that characterized Dr. O’Neal throughout her short life. The best collective way to honor her memory is to remain steadfast in our commitment to building stronger communities through education and health care delivery for all.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing distress related to this event, please consider accessing the resources available to our campus community, including the <a href="https://counseling.uic.edu">UIC Counseling Center</a>, the <a href="https://www.hr.uillinois.edu/benefits/worklife/eap">Employee Assistance Program</a>, or the <a href="https://can.uic.edu">Campus Advocacy Network</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear colleagues:</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, we wanted to share some of the remarkable progress we have made toward the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN) since the discussion forums at each of our universities earlier this fall.</p>
<p>We have formed the academic working groups that are helping develop DPI’s initial plans and priorities, and the 125 members from across the system who are sharing their talents have been added to our DPI website. We have begun DPI operations in our 20,000-square-foot facility at 200 South Wacker Drive in Chicago, where we are able to host research, education and outreach projects, events, courses, and meetings. We have officially applied for the $500 million in state capital funding that the legislature approved last spring to develop DPI and IIN, which includes the projects at our universities that we outlined at the discussion forums in August. And we have greatly improved our website, transitioning it from a concept site to one that reflects a living, active institute.</p>
<p>We have announced an IIN hub at Northern Illinois University, the first outside of the U of I System’s three universities. We also have had very positive conversations with every four-year public university in the state about becoming an IIN hub, and expect additional hub announcements.</p>
<p>As we continue our work, we hope many more of you will become involved. We invite you to join experts groups organized around DPI’s themes and cross-cutting areas, and to submit proposals for DPI research, education, and engagement activities. The experts groups will provide feedback to guide development of each theme and cross-cutting area. The proposals will produce the first wave of educational, research, and outreach activities at DPI and are eligible for up to $15,000 of seed funding per project.</p>
<p>The proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis beginning on Dec. 14. The expertise of our faculty and staff is a cornerstone of DPI and IIN, and we look forward to your creative proposals and your input through the experts groups.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you do for the U of I System.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tim Killeen<br />
President</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Change is one constant that large organizations must endure and manage on a regular basis. We are writing today to announce the resignation of Jeff Nearhoof, UIC’s Vice Chancellor for Advancement and UIF’s Senior Vice President of Development, effective at the close of business on December 31, 2018. Jeff has accepted an offer to serve as a Senior Vice President with the Chicago-based International Philanthropy consulting firm, Grenzebach Glier and Associates.</p>
<p>Over the past 5 years Jeff has made significant contributions to UIC’s advancement efforts. He has built a strong organization, he has designed and launched a new capital campaign and he has overseen the creation and the initial efforts of the new UIC alumni association. Please join us in wishing him well as he embarks on a new phase of his career, and in thanking him for his service to the University of Illinois at Chicago and the UI Foundation.</p>
<p>Jeff will continue to lead the UIC advancement team until he transitions at the end of December. A search for a new Vice Chancellor/Senior Vice President will commence immediately and more information regarding interim leadership will be forthcoming.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Colleagues:</p>
<p>Since the start of <strong>IGNITE: The Campaign for UIC</strong>, 1,437 of you and your faculty and staff colleagues have contributed more than $3.2 million.  In fact, 719 of you gave nearly $800,000 in FY18 alone.  Many of you joined the 3,233 donors who gave for the first time in FY18, totaling $842,500.  For this we are especially grateful and we welcome you to a community of proud UIC donors.</p>
<p><a href="http://advance.uic.edu/uic-annual-impact-report/">Please click through to see more of what giving has done at UIC this year. </a></p>
<p>It makes me proud to also share that in FY18 the gifted students we serve gave more than $21,000.  So far in the campaign 533 students have given just over $183,000.  Together with our students, alumni and friends we have contributed $366 million so far toward the IGNITE campaign. We couldn’t achieve this without your energy, ambition and drive.</p>
<p>I believe we share a focus to ignite a new standard in education and create opportunity for hungry minds from every background.  In this campaign, we have raised $36.8 million in scholarships and fellowships to do just that.  And, we want to bring bright minds together in innovative spaces to chase discoveries that change lives.  The $140.5 million designated to research, $11.3 million to establish professorships and chairs and $14.8 million toward new construction so far in the campaign will make an astounding impact toward this priority.</p>
<p>We in the Office of Advancement are grateful for your dedication to illuminating young minds, seeking opportunities for change and transforming discoveries into real and lasting progress for the world.  It drives us and inspires us every day to continue doing better and going higher.</p>
<p>As always, share your thoughts, ideas and feedback with me at 3-3391 or <a href="mailto:jeff5@uic.edu">jeff5@uic.edu</a>, or any one of my <a href="http://advance.uic.edu/about/directory/">Advancement colleagues</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for making me #UICProud.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Colleagues, UIC is pleased to announce a second year [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>UIC is pleased to announce a second year of funding for a program that encourages faculty to use open educational resources (OER) as alternatives to traditional text books for undergraduate courses. This incentive program is part of UIC’s student success initiative and was developed in response to student concerns about the high cost of course materials.</p>
<p>Many UIC students face financial challenges that impact their ability to achieve their educational goals. Studies suggest that the high cost of textbooks is one factor that affects learning outcomes and student success. Making free electronic OER materials readily available can help mitigate these problems.</p>
<p>UIC’s Open Textbook Faculty Incentive Program provides funds to teaching faculty or their respective departments as an incentive to provide electronic OER materials for use in courses. OER electronic materials are free and carry legal permission for open use. They can be shared and adapted freely.</p>
<p>An annual fund of $20,000 for the program will be available to UIC faculty who teach undergraduates. To qualify to participate in the program, faculty must adopt or adapt existing OER materials. Faculty may apply for a portion of this fund by submitting a proposal outlining how they plan to adopt or adapt existing OER resources in courses. Small funds are also available to faculty to review existing Open Educational Resources.  The deadline to submit a proposal is January 10, 2019. Awards will be announced by January 31, 2019.</p>
<p>The program is sponsored by the Office of the Provost and the University Library with support from the UIC Bookstore.</p>
<p>More information about open textbooks and the program can be found <a href="https://researchguides.uic.edu/opentextbooks/incentiveprogram">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear UIC Community,</p>
<p>I write to inform you of the creation of the new Office of the Vice Chancellor for Innovation (OVCI), as well as, the appointment of Dr. Anthony (TJ) Augustine, currently Associate Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation for the University of Illinois System, as the Interim Vice Chancellor for Innovation effective November 16, 2018, subject to approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>As a Carnegie I research university, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is a hub of innovation and cutting-edge research with a national and international reputation, providing an expansive education and healthcare enterprise throughout Illinois. At the same time, our strategic priorities emphasize the need and desire to become an even more entrepreneurial university in all aspects of our operations. And finally, we are committed to the success of the Illinois Innovation Network and the Discovery Partners Institute hub in Chicago.</p>
<p>The emphasis on these areas has led to the decision to organize UIC’s innovation and commercialization portfolio under one office (OVCI), which will have oversight of IT functions on campus (ACCC), distance and adult education programs (Extended Campus), and corporate relationships (Office of Corporate Relationships). The Vice Chancellor for Innovations (VCI) will also coordinate all of our IIN/DPI activities, as well as, the interactions with the Office of Technology Management and the Health Technology Incubator. The VCI will serve as a senior member of the leadership cabinet reporting directly to the Chancellor and will work collaboratively with the Deans, Provost/Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs and Vice Chancellor for Research. The OVCI will have a small number of staff and will be funded entirely from the University’s portion of royalty revenue. The creation of this new office was endorsed by the UIC Faculty Senate and the University of Illinois System.</p>
<p>Dr. Augustine’s experience and institutional knowledge make him the ideal person to establish this office and streamline its activities. His appointment is for a period of up to three years and will be followed by a national search. He is an alumnus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign earning a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Chemistry. He also earned a Master’s degree in Public Policy and a PhD in Chemistry at Stanford University.</p>
<p>In his role as Associate Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation, Dr. Augustine was responsible for providing strategic leadership in identifying potential public-private partnerships and enhancing connections among internal and external stakeholders, which will also be instrumental in his new capacity. Prior to his tenure in the University of Illinois System, he was the Technology-to-Market Advisor and Acting Deputy Director for Commercialization at the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E), where he helped prepare breakthrough energy technologies for transition from the lab to the marketplace. While at ARPA-E, he helped craft the agency’s commercialization strategy and particularly focused on a number of programs targeting biological production of transportation fuels.</p>
<p>He also served as Special Assistant to Secretaries Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz at the Department of Energy, where he acted as the Secretary’s principal liaison to senior staff in the areas including energy technology development, environmental management, and national security. Prior to the Department of Energy, Dr. Augustine worked as an OSA/SPIE/AAAS Science and Technology Fellow in the office of Senator Richard Durbin and provided advice on energy and environmental issues.</p>
<p>Please join me in welcoming TJ to this new and exciting leadership role, which will have the potential to advance UIC’s strategic priorities and the commercialization endeavors of our faculty and students.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael D. Amiridis<br />
Chancellor</p>
