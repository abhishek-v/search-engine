<p>UIC coach Tasha Pointer knew facing Northwestern at Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston would be tough.</p>
<p>“Obviously, we wanted to win,” she said. “We didn’t give our best effort.”</p>
<p>The difficult road game Nov. 15 against the Wildcats was scheduled way before the former NU assistant coach left last season to coach the Flames.</p>
<p>Thursday night’s game was the first time Pointer had appeared at Welsh-Ryan as a head coach. And though UIC lost 87-44, she feels the matchup can have a positive impact.</p>
<p>“Northwestern came out and punched us first and we didn’t know how to respond,” Pointer told reporters after the game. “For UIC, we have to allow this game to drive us to be better.”</p>
<p>NU coach Joe McKeown praised Pointer’s performance.</p>
<p>“I just think great things are ahead for her at UIC,” he said. “They made a commitment to women’s basketball when they hired her last spring. I think you’re going to see that over the next couple of years.”</p>
<p>Pointer is confident the Flames will bounce back.</p>
<p>“First of all,  Coach McKeown is a phenomenal coach. One of the things that I learned from him was — no matter what — run your stuff and have great expectations of your team and have your team execute,” she said.</p>
<p>Pointer had hoped for a more triumphant homecoming after beating Valparaiso 75-65 on Nov. 7.</p>
<p>“Coming into the (NU) game I was just conflicted,” she said. “Who wants to lose to their former team and, for that matter, any team?”</p>
<p>Anytime you take over a program that hasn’t been as successful, “you have to appreciate these moments and in between because they are teaching moments,” Pointer said.</p>
<p>“Moving forward, for us at UIC, it is allowing moments like this to help elevate our mentality, our culture and really transform the program,” she said.</p>

<p>More than 300 people — kids with cancer or sickle cell disease and their families — celebrated the holidays at UIC Nov. 17. The event, which was hosted by the pediatric hematology/oncology department of the Children&#8217;s Hospital University of Illinois, included a Thanksgiving-inspired meal, holiday crafts, dancing and a gift exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today is not about being a doctor or a patient,&#8221; said Dr. Mary Lou Schmidt, professor of pediatrics and head of pediatric hematology and oncology. &#8220;It&#8217;s about having fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volunteers from the Girl Scouts, A Silver Lining, Bear Necessities and others helped kids use paint, paper, beads and a host of other materials to make holiday crafts. Students from the UIC College of Dentistry dressed up as tooth fairies and as &#8220;Mr. Molar,&#8221; encouraging kids to practice good brushing habits with a novelty-sized toothbrush and stuffed animals. Dunkin&#8217; Donuts provided supplies so kids could decorate their donuts, and eat their dessert before lunch if desired. The Joffrey Ballet’s Exelon Strobel Dancers danced for and with attendees, young and old.</p>
<p>For Kelly, mom of an 18-month-old with leukemia, the event was also a celebration of her daughter&#8217;s progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kathryn was diagnosed one year ago today,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At this time last year, we were in the hospital. To see her running around today, healthy, means everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event was also meaningful to Kelly because two of Kathryn&#8217;s three siblings were also there, along with their dad and Kelly&#8217;s husband, Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to spend so much time apart,&#8221; said Kelly, who spent more than 190 days in the hospital last year with her daughter. &#8220;Finding time to be together means everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schmidt says the event is about relationships and celebration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cancer or sickle cell and a number of other conditions have touched everyone in this room, but we have so much to celebrate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have so many wonderful stories to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Javontae, 24, a Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma survivor, attended the event with his mom, sister, friend and a few cousins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love being here with my family,&#8221; said Javontae, who has been in remission for eight years. He said that while most of the activities are for younger kids, he still has a good time, especially with his younger family members.</p>
<p>Supporting the event were more than 50 UIC volunteers, primarily from the College of Medicine, and 10 organizations, including Flashes of Hope, Gilda&#8217;s Club, Holiday Heroes, Ladies Philoptochos Society and North Star Reach.</p>

Photo: Abigail Floresca</p></div>
<p>As the months grow colder and the night comes sooner, the school days are getting more difficult to endure for me. Living close to campus, spending the whole week walking the same paths, taking the same buses, and longingly gazing at the towering skyline from the same vantage point, I start to feel trapped. I start to forget that I live in one of the most brilliant cities on this planet.</p>
<p>That is why I was so excited to hear in one of my classes about the new exhibit open this winter at the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;entry=s&amp;sa=X&amp;ftid=0x880e28fcf5c75bdb:0x26c50174d0fc68ed&amp;gmm=CgIgAQ%3D%3D">Stony Island Arts Bank</a> on the South Side. In honor of the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Chicago’s chapter of the Black Panther Party, the “ICONIC: BLACK PANTHER,” exhibit features rooms of art from local artists, as well as renowned artists from the movement like Emory Douglas.</p>
<p>I had never before heard of the Stony Island Arts Bank, and I can’t believe I have lived in the city for two years without experiencing it. The building, converted from an old bank on Stony Island Avenue, is now a vibrant space filled with art, media and literature on the second floor. It was renovated ultimately to engage in rich South Side history. The art in the exhibit was powerful and thoughtful, and it reminds me of the dense history that exists in our city. To be mindful of the struggle and resistance against racist policy and oppressed blacks, Latinx, and virtually every minority who has lived in this city, I believe is incredibly vital to learning how to be self-aware in an urban space.</p>
<p>There is so much to learn and appreciate about Chicago, and a great way of starting to do that is through engaging and supporting the art produced by local artists. There is so much more value to a piece than an “aesthetic” for a profile picture; ask questions, dig deeper, find out the context, history, and the background of the artist. I promise you will get so much more out of it. Visit the Stony Island Arts Bank and tell others about it.</p>

Writing is how she connects, processes, expresses and relates to the rest of the world. Increasingly aware of the power of storytelling in bringing about change and reform, Abigail earnestly seeks to find a way to incorporate a perfect blend of writing and social work within the criminal justice system — she dreams of bringing about a positive change, one story at a time.

<p>Make an impact at UIC during IGNITE GivingTuesday on Nov. 27 — a day that aims to unify the campus community under the act of giving back.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the global giving holiday on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, UIC’s participating in GivingTuesday encourages the campus community to celebrate how broad participating can make a difference. For more information or to donate, visit <a href="http://givingtuesday.uic.edu"><em>givingtuesday.uic.edu</em></a></p>
<p>“This is a way for the entire UIC campus, along with alumni and friends, to come together with a common goal of encouraging participation and raising as much as we can to help support UIC faculty, students and everyone in the UIC community,” said Meredith Howell, executive director of participation in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Advancement. “The best thing about this initiative is that it truly does make a tremendous impact. We all come together, and it’s so inspiring.”</p>
<p>Last year, IGNITE GivingTuesday raised more than $117,000 from about 700 donors.</p>
<p>IGNITE GivingTuesday is part of a larger fundraising campaign on campus, called “IGNITE: The Campaign for UIC,” which launched last fall. The campaign’s goal is to raise $750 million over five years to forge the future of education by redefining the student experience, empowering faculty, driving discovery and connecting to communities.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 15, the campaign has raised more than $360 million — 48 percent of its goal.</p>
<p>“The IGNITE campaign aims to raise funds for student scholarships, endowed faculty positions, research and teaching technologies and improved campus facilities,” Howell said. “We are all invested in making a tremendous impact at UIC.”</p>

What year are you now? What is your major?</p>
<p>“I am an English major.”</p>
<p>“What would you do with that after college?” “What can you be employed for?” “Can you make a good living?”</p>
<p>All these questions are expected, especially from people who are not familiar with the idea of studying “English.” As an English major, there are a lot of jobs and opportunities available after graduating from the university. Attaining an English degree diversifies one’s job options as there are different corporations searching for writers. Moreover, the ability to write concisely and coherently and communicate probably has become an essential element for hiring in the corporate world. Thus, having a solidified English degree provides one with a good chance of employment.</p>
<p>The Office of Undergraduate Studies in English create events that promote the idea of job availability for students with English degrees.</p>
<p>On Nov. 13, the English department hosted an event called &#8220;Ask Alumni.&#8221; This event invited UIC alumni to discuss their career paths after graduating with an English degree. They also answered questions from undergraduate students about internships and jobs. This event has become an excellent medium for English undergraduate students to network, as well as become confident about their career path after college.</p>

		<description><![CDATA['What UIC taught me is the importance of being an instructional leader.']]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wN8XYtRnYo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Janice Jackson has been involved in the Chicago Public Schools her entire life. She was a CPS student from Head Start, an early education program for low-income families, through 12th grade, then began her teaching career at Chicago South Shore High School. Since that time, Jackson has served as a principal, network chief, the chief education officer and now as chief executive officer for CPS, the third largest school district in the country. Since assuming the role of chief education officer in 2015, Jackson has focused on building equity, excellence and access across the district, especially with regard to CPS high schools. Jackson is a progressive, forward-thinking educator who believes in setting the bar high. Jackson holds a Master of Education degree with a field of study in leadership and administration, as well as a Doctor of Education degree with a field of study in urban education leadership, both from the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>UIC:</strong> To begin, what roles do you envision the UIC College of Education playing to support the CPS’ vision to provide a world-class education for its students?</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Well, I think UIC plays several roles; the first and most notable is to provide teachers for Chicago Public Schools. UIC has provided teachers through a pipeline from its teacher education program for decades and I see that as the most critical support they can give to Chicago Public Schools. Through the <a href="https://catalog.uic.edu/gcat/colleges-schools/education/urban-ed-lead/">Urban Leadership Program</a> in the College of Education, the work they are doing around identifying high-quality principals to lead and transform schools is definitely a game changer for our school system, where we have seen a remarkable turnaround. Just having a place, or destination, for Chicago Public School student graduates. I was at Epic Academy High School on the Southeast Side and met a young lady who was featured on the news for getting more than a million dollars in scholarships, but she’s going to the University of Illinois and when she said that to me, I was so thrilled.</p>
<p><strong>UIC:</strong> What message would you like to provide to aspiring teachers and administrators at UIC who want to become a part of CPS?</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> I think that many of the values that we share as an organization are the same values that UIC possesses, so I think that is a good place to start. One thing that I would say is that for the teacher education programs, we like to see more graduates leaving those programs, working for Chicago Public Schools, and really seeing it as a career and a destination, not just a first stop. I really want to make sure that the program is prioritizing how you help develop teachers who can work in urban school settings and teachers who are going to be able to come in and transform schools through what they do in their classrooms. I think UIC&#8217;s principal training program is doing that on a large scale, and I would like to see more and more of that from the teacher program. The advice that I would give them is to look for schools that have effective school leaders. The principal plays a critical role in school transformation and school quality. Oftentimes, especially with new teachers, they select schools for a variety of reasons. I would say the primary thing they should be looking at is school leadership. School leadership is going to determine the support they receive once they become teachers, and it definitely has a correlation to how long they are going to remain teachers.</p>
<p><strong>UIC:</strong> Can you discuss how the <a href="https://education.uic.edu/">College of Education</a> at UIC prepared you for your role as an instructor and as a school administrator?</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> I had a wonderful experience at UIC. When I say that ‘I am UIC,’ I truly believe that. In addition, I learned a lot in my master’s program as I was getting my certification and master’s degree to be a school leader and principal. This notion, which is commonplace now, that principals are instructional leaders, was new back in the early 2000s when I was in that program. It really shaped my identity as a school leader and administrator. Operational and communication skills are critically important when you lead a community. What UIC taught me is the importance of being an instructional leader and that the principal is the lead learner in every school building. Your major focus has to be on developing the capacity of others and that makes the school better in so many different ways. I would say that is the biggest impact of what I learned at UIC. Also at UIC, having access to some of the best professors in the country is definitely an added benefit. UIC&#8217;s Urban Educational Institute for School Leadership is one of the most renowned programs in the country. People come from all over to see what UIC is doing to produce principals. I am just lucky to be one of those former principals, who is now leading a district where we have access to that pipeline because I really believe they are developing people who can go to any school and turn it around.</p>
<p><strong>UIC:</strong> How did the Urban Education Leadership Doctorate Program prepare you for your role as Chicago Public Schools chief executive officer?</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> This notion of ‘continuous improvement’ is a big part of the UIC motto. Even when you succeed and you hit a goal, the next one is always there and you should have your eye on trying to continue to improve. The program teaches you how to do that in a very practical and scalable way. I have been in and known of programs that are well defined and well designed, but they are all theory. Sometimes practitioners may be somewhat familiar with the research but not immersed in it, or there are people who know the research front-and-back but they are practicing it. UIC does an excellent job of marrying theory and practice, and oftentimes, there is not that marriage. What you see from leaders who have gone through UIC’s program is that they understand both the theory and the practical implications of the work. I love policy and I am a policy wonk. A lot of that was cultivated and developed in the UIC studies program centered on urban leadership that taught us different frameworks and how you look at policy and analyze it, and how you create it and implement it. I think I bring many of those tools to this role. One of the first things that I changed when I became chief education officer was to think about the ways we change policy here in the district. UIC really provided us with a lot of research and frameworks around how to get buy-in from people on the ground. As CEO, one of my goals is to make sure that we operate as a full district, not a set of individual schools. There is no better way to do that than making sure that the leaders at the school level are involved in policy creation, formation and implementation. That is something that is a direct result of my participation in the UIC program.</p>
<p><strong>UIC:</strong> This year, UIC announced the <a href="https://today.uic.edu/uics-chancellors-fellows-program-targets-stellar-illinois-students">Chancellor Fellows Aim High</a> initiative, which offers incoming high achieving high school students an opportunity to have their tuition and fees paid for if they stay in state, and the <a href="https://today.uic.edu/call-me-mister-initiative-comes-to-uic-to-train-more-teachers-of-color">Call Me MISTER</a> program, which is designed to increase the percentage of male teachers of color teaching in elementary schools. How do you think recent initiatives undertaken at UIC will help draw more CPS graduates?</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> I believe the two initiatives show a commitment by UIC leadership to try and attract a diverse group of students. The UIC Chancellor’s Fellows Program, which is designed to recruit and retain highly qualified students from Illinois by offering full tuition, will be very attractive to high-achieving CPS graduates, many of whom will be the first in their family to attend college. UIC’s Call Me MISTER program is another initiative that is desperately needed. The program offers students pursuing approved programs of study in urban teacher education the opportunity to receive full tuition, as well as room and board with the aim of teaching in the classroom. With only 2 percent of teachers in American public grade schools being black males, there is a huge need for these male role models in the classroom at CPS, as well as other school districts, and UIC is helping to fill the need.</p>
<p><strong>UIC:</strong> As an alumna, please complete the following: The UIC College of Education is…</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Amazing. I truly owe everything that I am from a leadership perspective to the program. I definitely think I brought many natural attributes there. I was developing nicely prior to going into the UIC programs, but I definitely feel like it strengthened me as a leader. I draw on so many of the things that I learned in both programs every single day in this role as chief executive officer. I would just say that it was an amazing experience, and I made the right choice going to UIC.</p>

<p>At UIC, 1,247 students pledged to vote in the Midterm Elections in the All in to Vote challenge, which Stony Brook University won with 1,328 students taking the pledge. All in to Vote is an initiative of the nonprofit Civic Nation.</p>
<p>“UIC provides opportunities to encourage or provide the context that people’s voices do matter,” said Spencer Long, director of UIC Student Leadership and Civic Engagement. “Our students did vote, and it did matter.”</p>
<p>The number of early voters at UIC rose considerably compared with the February primary, Long said, when 342 voters cast their ballots at UIC.<br />
“We did exponentially better than we did in primary voting,” Long said.</p>
<p>UIC hosted early voting on campus from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2, along with student engagement activities, including a “Party at the Polls” each day and parades to the polls each hour.</p>

<p>The Flames will face Michigan State in the first round of the NCAA tournament at 6 p.m. Thursday in East Lansing after winning the Horizon League Championship Saturday night.</p>
<p>The announcement of the first round matchup was greeted with applause and cries of support Monday by team members, coaches, supporters and UIC staff who had assembled in the Granderson Suite to watch the selection show. Head coach Sean Phillips thanked the crowd for its support.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the automatic qualifier out of the Horizon League, our players will have the opportunity to represent not only themselves, but also UIC and the Horizon League,&#8221; Phillips said.  &#8220;Michigan State has proven over the years to be a national-level program with multiple deep runs in the NCAA tournament. We have had some excellent battles with them over the years in the preseason, regular season and postseason. We look forward to the chance to test ourselves on the national stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The teams have some history in the national tournament. They met on MSU&#8217;s pitch in a 2008 second-round game, which ended in a 0-0 draw. UIC advanced to the Sweet 16 with a 3-2 penalty kick shootout victory. The squads played regularly during the &#8217;90s and have met six times in Phillips&#8217; tenure at UIC.</p>
<p>UIC claimed its third straight Horizon League championship Saturday night with a 3-1 win over Wright State. <dfn><a href="https://uicflames.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=5954" rel="smarttag" rev="5954">Josiah Ash</a></dfn> put the Flames up 1-0 with a fifth-minute goal, and <dfn><a href="https://uicflames.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=5960" rel="smarttag" rev="5960">Pau Mateo</a></dfn> scored his first goal later in the half.  After Wright State halved the margin late in the match, Ash struck again to remove all doubt from the outcome.</p>
<p>UIC moved to 12-5-2 on the season, eclipsing last season&#8217;s win total and notching the most victories since 2013.  After a regular season draw at Wright State (13-3-3), the Flames used a complete team effort on both ends of the field to defeat the No. 1 seed on their home pitch.</p>
<p><dfn><a href="https://uicflames.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=5943" rel="smarttag" rev="5943">Jacob Graiber</a></dfn>, who was on the defending end of countless through balls and attempted advances throughout UIC&#8217;s two tournament games, was named tournament MVP.  He was joined on the All-Tournament Team by Ash, <dfn><a href="https://uicflames.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=5939" rel="smarttag" rev="5939">Nestor Garcia</a></dfn>, and <dfn><a href="https://uicflames.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=5941" rel="smarttag" rev="5941">Oscar Gonzalez</a></dfn>.</p>
<p>The Flames achieved the first back-to-back-to-back championships in school history. They moved into sole possession of most Horizon League tournament titles, with their sixth (1999, 2000, 2007, 2016, 2017, 2018).  Combined with the regular season title in 2015, the senior class will leave having won four trophies, which is also a UIC first. The team will make its eighth NCAA tournament appearance.</p>

Or do you like to listen to live narration of stories, poems or sonnets? If you do, you will not want to miss the last Open Mic Night for the fall semester Nov. 30.</p>
<p>This event will occur in Grant Hall (GH) room 106 and from 4 to 6 p.m. The English department wants to create a frequent avenue for English students and other writers to share, as well as listen to, each other’s work.</p>
<p>Allison James, program coordinator for the English department in the Undergraduate Studies Office, said the English department&#8217;s Open Mic Night will become a frequent event held each month during the academic year.</p>
<p>“The English Department has always done open mic, but moving forward open mic will be more frequent,” James said.</p>
