<h3>Research Completed in 2018</h3>
<p><a href="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Circulator-edited.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4828" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Circulator-edited-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Circulator-edited-300x220.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Circulator-edited-768x563.jpg 768w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Circulator-edited-1024x751.jpg 1024w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Circulator-edited.jpg 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><strong>Central Area Circulator<br />
</strong>The evolution of Chicago’s efforts to address the distribution and circulation of people in the Central Area is chronicled in a newly published UTC paper, &#8220;The History of the City of Chicago Central Area Transit Circulation Efforts.&#8221; Proposals for downtown public transit and efforts in the second half of 20th Century to build the Chicago Circulator, an on-street light rail technology system, also are analyzed. Read <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/the-history-of-the-city-of-chicago-central-area-transit-circulation-efforts/">the abstract</a> to get access to the paper, or gain a new perspective from a <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/incremental-approach-may-have-given-green-light-to-proposed-1990s-chicago-central-area-circulator-project/">news story</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EV Charging Infrastructure<br />
</strong>A recently-finalized study provides policy insights into integrating electronic vehicle (EV) infrastructure development with transit systems. Using EV can help eliminate last mile challenges and reduce emissions. <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/integrated-approaches-to-ev-charging-infrastructure-and-transit-system-planning/">Read an abstract</a> and access the complete report.</p>
<h3>Research Completed in 2017</h3>
<p><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4615" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Benefit-roi_edited-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="142" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Benefit-roi_edited-300x211.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Benefit-roi_edited-768x541.jpg 768w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Benefit-roi_edited-1024x721.jpg 1024w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Benefit-roi_edited.jpg 1529w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" />Framework for Intercity Rail ROI</strong>. Several states have pursued new high-speed and intercity passenger rail (HS&amp;IPR) services to keep up with an unprecedented surge in ridership since 2000. Amtrak, the primary intercity rail service provider in the country, reported more than 30 million passenger rides in 2015, a significant increase when compared to 2000 ridership statistics.  A team from the UTC completed a report that resulted in a framework to present the return on investment from HS&amp;IPR that explicitly allows for a variety of alternative perspectives, including spatial areas of concern (national, regional or local benefits) and the viewpoints of specific stakeholders.</p>
<p>The study takes an integrative approach to encapsulate all benefit and cost elements involved in conventional benefit-cost analysis (BCA), economic impact analysis (EIA), and social impact analysis (SIA). BCA is an assessment process focusing on the overall benefits and costs incurred in the lifetime of a project and depicting the benefits and costs in terms of the net present value.</p>
<p>The report, “<a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/framework-for-assessing-the-roi-for-high-speed-and-intercity-rail-projects/">Framework for Assessing the ROI for High-Speed and Intercity Rail Projects</a><strong>,</strong>” is comprised of five chapters that address the need for a framework to address ROI, cost elements, benefit and impact elements, the methodology employed and the specific framework developed.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4536" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Engagement-Chart_edited-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />IDOT Public Engagement. </strong>The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) has committed to improving its public engagement program and the quantity and quality of feedback and ideas it receives from Illinois residents. In 2016, IDOT commissioned a study — <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/recommendations-to-the-illinois-department-of-transportation-to-enhance-quality-public-engagement/">&#8220;Recommendations to Enhance Quality Engagement&#8221;</a> — to identify effective public engagement strategies for statewide Departments of Transportation.</p>
<p>To build on the 2016 report, researchers from the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement (IPCE) and the Urban Transportation Center (UTC) completed a follow-up study in early 2017 that utilized an innovative online approach to supplement IDOT’s traditional public engagement methods.  Through a multi-phased process, residents of Illinois voted on and submitted ideas and ranked their priorities related to transportation goals and modes.  The unique strength of this multi-phased process was its ability to capture high quality ideas from the public <em>and</em> statistically representative public priorities – it was both open and representative.</p>

<p><strong>Illinois Maritime Transportation System. </strong>Illinois has 1,118 miles of navigable waterways passing through or bordering the state. From a commercial <img class="alignright wp-image-4521 size-medium" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Maritime-Freight-Research-Map-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Maritime-Freight-Research-Map-223x300.jpg 223w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Maritime-Freight-Research-Map-768x1032.jpg 768w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Maritime-Freight-Research-Map-762x1024.jpg 762w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Maritime-Freight-Research-Map.jpg 1282w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />transportation perspective, these navigable rivers and Lake Michigan make up the Illinois Maritime Transportation System.  The system primarily transports freight. Passenger travel on these waters is most often for recreation.  Industries based in Illinois are responsible for nearly 20% of the waterborne freight shipments in the United States; however, Illinois has a fragmented system to provide oversight and support for the maritime industry.</p>
<p>In summer of 2017, the UTC produced a research report, &#8220;<a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/an-analysis-of-the-illinois-maritime-transportation-system/">An Analysis of the Illinois Maritime Transportation System</a>,&#8221; that provides IDOT with an analysis of the Illinois Maritime Transportation System in order to effectively plan, develop and implement maritime into a comprehensive statewide transportation system.</p>
<p><strong>Integration of Transit Modes. </strong> Transportation agencies can launch regional efforts to integrate busses, trains and other transit options by first deciding on the mission or vision from participating organizations or agencies and setting up a process to collect performance, financial and operational data.</p>
<p>Four other components needed for effective transit integration include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing the roles performed by planning, provider and funding agencies.</li>
<li>Determining the level of integration of various resources, such as equipment, people and existing infrastructure.</li>
<li>Linking information technology systems from participating agencies.</li>
<li>And, setting the organizational structure for planning, operations, policy and financial roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>These six components were key findings from a research report, “<a href="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Integration-of-Modes-Report-Final-July-2017.pdf">Integration of Transportation for Improved Mobility</a>,” which presents a broad perspective on the history, benefits and challenges behind regional transportation integration.  <strong>UTC Director Dr. P.S. Sriraj</strong> and <strong>Dr. Paul Metaxatos</strong>, Associate Director for Research Programs coordinated the project.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-4482" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/New-Starts_edited-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="181" />New Starts Ranking.  </strong>Establishment of consistent guidelines to evaluate the merits of federally-funded transportation projects considered under the New Starts program could create best practices that will lead to a more streamlined selection process and demonstrate greater government transparency. This summary encapsulates the findings of a study undertaken to analyze the decision-making process for allocating federal dollars to help fund rail, bus, streetcar and rapid transit projects that are part of long-range local or regional plans.</p>
<p>A research team from the Urban Transportation Center at UIC conducted interviews with representatives from seven transportation agencies and metropolitan planning organizations to gain insight into how transit capital projects were reviewed and prioritized before a request got submitted for New Starts funding. As noted in the report, “<a href="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ranking-Northeast-Illinois-New-Starts-Transit-Potential-Expansion-for-Metra-and-CTA-Final-Report.pdf">A Review of Capital Improvement Grant Program and the Need for a Uniform Project Selection Process</a>,” the New Starts selection process criteria differed within regions of the nation over time. Visit <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/a-review-of-capital-improvement-grant-program-and-the-need-for-a-uniform-project-selection-process/">this page</a> to read an abstract of the New Starts report project, or <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ranking-Northeast-Illinois-New-Starts-Transit-Potential-Expansion-for-Metra-and-CTA-Final-Report.pdf">download the complete report</a>.  The project was coordinated by <strong>UTC Director Dr. P.S. Sriraj</strong>.</p>

<p>Researchers came to that conclusion by building a “logic model” or formal process to evaluate the effectiveness of the program and an integrated theory-driven framework for future implementation of a revised TTP. The findings are outlined in “<a href="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Travel-Training-Report-Final_version.pdf">CPS Travel Training Evaluation Project,</a>” a report designed to assess the potential costs and benefits of expanding the current program.  The project was coordinated by <strong>UTC Director Dr. P.S. Sriraj</strong> and <strong>Dr. Eric Welsh</strong>, Director of the Center for Science Technology and Environmental Policy Studies and Professor of Public Affairs at Arizona State University.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4280" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/ROI-survey-chart_edited-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/ROI-survey-chart_edited-300x199.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/ROI-survey-chart_edited-768x510.jpg 768w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/ROI-survey-chart_edited-1024x679.jpg 1024w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/ROI-survey-chart_edited.jpg 1385w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Return on Investment for Passenger Rail. </strong>Significant investment in the passenger rail network across the United States can result in a wide range of economic benefits including greater productivity, higher property values and reduced costs to other transportation modes. Furthermore, dollars spent on expanding and improving passenger rail will provide people with the ability to move around more freely and easily.</p>
<p>These are two key findings from a survey of transportation professionals polled for a study on the potential economic and societal gains realized through greater funding for passenger rail service. <strong>UTC</strong> <strong>Director Dr. P.S. Sriraj</strong> led the project, which resulted in a report, &#8220;Results from a Survey of Transportation Professionals Regarding the Return on Investment for Passenger Rail.&#8221; Sixty-six professionals from the public and private sectors participated in the survey, which was conducted in 2016. Participants represented nine areas of the transportation industry – from agency leadership and operations management to consultants and economic development specialists.</p>
<p>A goal of the research was to develop an integrated framework of knowledge regarding benefits gained from passenger rail investment.

<p><strong>Catching Up to Automated Vehicle Technology.</strong> Much of the research and public discussion on the development of Automated Vehicle (AV) technology has focused on passenger vehicles but the widespread<img class="alignright wp-image-4363 size-medium" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/AV-State-Role-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/AV-State-Role-300x197.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/AV-State-Role.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> introduction of AV technologies will have major impacts on freight industry in the near future. Freight is expected to be an early adopter of AV technology as even limited implementation of the technologies will lead to substantial reductions in fuel costs, increased efficiency in scheduling and bundling shipments and possible increased flexibility in other costs through increased hours of operations.</p>
<p>In May 2017, the UTC produced a report, &#8220;Catching up to Automated Technology: How DOTs Can Stay Ahead of the Curve For Freight,&#8221; that provides analysis on the potential benefits and challenges automated technology holds for freight.  The findings indicate that relatively simple actions by government agencies can help them recognize what legal and regulatory changes will be necessary as well as physical changes to the transportation infrastructure need to be made so that technologies can be safely introduced and their full potential can be achieved. <strong>Bob Ginsburg, UTC Research Assistant Professor, </strong>served as principal investigator.  Learn more from <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/catching-up-to-automated-technology-how-dots-can-stay-ahead-of-the-curve-for-freight/">the project abstract</a> and get access to the complete report.</p>

The <strong><em>Columbia Chronicle</em><em> </em></strong>asked <strong>UTC Director Dr. P.S. Sriraj</strong> for his thoughts.  Read this <a href="http://www.columbiachronicle.com/metro/article_6275695c-dc8d-11e7-befe-b3594c587cdf.html">December 11 article</a> from reporter Blaise Mesa to learn more.</p>
<p>The horrific attack on cyclists in New York City prompted the <em><strong>Columbia Chronicle</strong></em> to publish <a href="http://www.columbiachronicle.com/metro/article_66cabef2-c677-11e7-bf12-a3cb603a9922.html">a report November 13</a> on bike safety along paths in Chicago. <strong>UTC Director Dr. P.S. Sriraj</strong> offered thoughts in the report written by Savannah Eaden.</p>
<p>Metra will hold public hearings this fall to address its budget and gain insight from the public on service. On November 1, <strong>UTC Director Dr. P.S. Sriraj</strong> was interviewed by Jason Marck about Metra&#8217;s future during <a href="https://www.wbez.org/shows/morning-shift/metra-to-hear-from-public-at-annual-meeting/43b99d15-040f-40dd-ba25-25fccbbb286c?utm_source=url&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Web-Share">a live segment</a> aired on the <strong>WBEZ</strong> radio program<em><strong> Morning Shift</strong></em>.</p>
<p>In fall, the Chicago Transit Authority announced it plans to replace fabric seating with hard-surface seating on some el cars and buses prompted a report from the <strong><em>Columbia Chronicle</em></strong> newspaper. <strong>UTC Director Dr. P.S.

<p><strong>TOD Studio Report. </strong>Identifying the benefit of putting surplus land allocated for parking to more productive use for future redevelopment projects was among the <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4133" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/TOD-1-edited-300x244.jpg" alt="tod-1-edited" width="300" height="244" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/TOD-1-edited-300x244.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/TOD-1-edited.jpg 592w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />findings of UIC graduate student research teams charged with preparing plans to enhance the financial value and vibrancy of two different <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/">Chicago Transit Authority</a> (CTA) rapid transit stations.</p>
<p>The student teams developed the so-called transit oriented development (TOD) reports through a graduate-level studio course offered by the <a href="http://www.uic.edu/">University of Illinois at Chicago</a> in the Spring 2016 semester. One team studied the <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/travel_information/station.aspx?StopId=93">Linden station</a> on the Purple Line in Wilmette, and the other team focused on the <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/travel_information/station.aspx?StopId=20">Ashland/63rd station</a> on the Green Line in Chicago’s Englewood community.  The student teams conducted research into the communities, the surrounding residential and commercial markets and the constraints and potential of the CTA stations. An analysis was completed of CTA-owned parking lots adjacent to both stations to determine usage and market value. Read a <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/uic-students-develop-strategic-transit-oriented-development-plans-to-capture-economic-benefits-improve-vibrancy-of-two-cta-rapid-transit-stations-news-story/">news story</a>, and <a href="mailto:ebury@uic.edu">contact us</a> to request a copy of the TOD Studio report.  On December 22, <em><strong>Wilmette Life</strong></em> reporter Kathy Routliffe filed <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/wilmette/news/ct-wml-linden-cta-transportation-study-tl-1229-20161222-story.html">a report</a> on the proposed recommendations for the Linden station.</p>
<p><strong>Transit Agencies and Extreme Weather. </strong>Transit agency professionals have a moderate-to-high level of confidence that the systems they manage will continue to operate during an extreme weather event, while acknowledging that extreme weather incidents are happening more often and becoming more severe. And, case studies of two transit agencies revealed: 1) Commuters use below grade rapid transit stations more often during heavy rain or snow than above-ground stations. 2) Installation of shelters and benches at bus stops or on subway platforms<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4012" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Weather-Survey-Chart-300x178.jpg" alt="extreme-weather-survey-chart" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Weather-Survey-Chart-300x178.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Weather-Survey-Chart-768x456.jpg 768w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Weather-Survey-Chart.jpg 889w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> helps maintain ridership on extreme weather days, and may even cut down on ridership loss during extreme weather events.</p>
<p>These are among the conclusions reached by researchers studying the impact of severe weather on public transit systems. Two separate reports were prepared and managed by the <a href="http://www.utc.uic.edu/">Urban Transportation Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago</a>, with support from researchers at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>.

<p><strong>Rail Transit Expansion in Chicago Central Area. </strong> A study managed by the UTC resulted in <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/the-case-for-rail-transit-expansion-in-the-chicago-central-area/">a whitepaper</a> that proposes the design, funding and creation of a new transit line called the “Connector. Its goal <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4099" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Connector-image-300x221.jpg" alt="connector-image" width="300" height="221" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Connector-image-300x221.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Connector-image.jpg 568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />would be to add needed capacity in the central are of Chicago, the fastest-growing part of the city. Assuming a 7-10 year implementation time frame, the Connector’s first phase would come online just as north and northwest side “L” lines reached capacity. This would enable the central area to absorb a larger share of subsequent increases in transit demand.</p>
<p>The paper recommends construction of 14 miles of new transit line; approximately 2/3 would be located on or adjacent to existing rail right-of-way, vacant land or public property. The Connector would be built in phases and would be funded by a 0.25% property tax increment levied through a special service area (SSA). The central area is dependent on rail transit, and the majority of central area workers use transit to get to their jobs. Researcher <strong>Ed Zotti</strong> was principal investigator.</p>

<p><strong>Benefiting From an Off-Peak Delivery Program in Chicago.</strong> Reduced traffic congestion, better air quality, more efficient distribution of goods to businesses and stores, and an improved environment for pedestrians <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3881" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/OPD-Map-267x300.jpg" alt="OPD Map" width="267" height="300" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/OPD-Map-267x300.jpg 267w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/OPD-Map.jpg 686w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" />would be key benefits from implementing an off-peak delivery (OPD) program in congested parts of Chicago.</p>
<p>To make such a program happen, business and civic leaders will need to encourage it and the City would need to make it a priority. A formal pilot program could be a useful step to test the idea, measure the public and private benefits, and address possible concerns of supply chain carriers, businesses and residents.</p>
<p>Those were among conclusions reached in a recent report on policies and practices that can be used to shift deliveries of goods from congested peak traffic periods to less-congested off-peak times. Off-peak delivery programs have reduced costs and improved traffic flow in several domestic and international markets.

<p>More needs to be done to provide people with the transportation options they need to reach jobs, schools and other destinations. Among the recommendations: broaden the role of public transit agencies to achieve mobility goals, change the way transit systems are funded, and adopt a commute trip reduction program.</p>
<p>Those were among the conclusions from a recently-completed report that analyzed existing transit services and challenges within the Chicago region and identified ways to deliver affordable, reliable and abundant mobility options. This <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/integrated-technology-innovative-services-changes-in-policy-funding-critical-to-increasing-mobility-in-metropolitan-chicago-news-story/">news story</a> provides more details on the mobility study, and the entire report can be downloaded from <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/research/increasing-mobility-through-enhanced-transit-connectivity/">this abstract</a>.  UTC researchers <strong>James C. LaBelle</strong> and <strong>Sheena F. Frève </strong>completed the study.  On October 10, <strong><em>Crain&#8217;s Chicago Business</em></strong> published <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20161010/OPINION/161019997/how-to-get-chicagoans-to-ditch-their-cars#utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ccb-dailyalert&amp;utm_campaign=ccb-dailyalert-20161010">an online commentary</a> by Mr. LaBelle on one key finding from the mobility research. And, the Active Transportation Alliance published <a href="http://activetrans.org/blog/region-needs-mobility-partnerships">a blog </a>on the research.</p>
<p><strong>Pedestrian/Bicyclist Perceptions on Safety at CTA Grade Crossings</strong>. Women are more safety-conscious than men when proceeding across street-level rail crossings, while guys 21 years old and younger who are in a <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3885" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Kedzie-Av-Image-300x227.jpg" alt="Kedzie Av Image" width="300" height="227" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Kedzie-Av-Image-300x227.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Kedzie-Av-Image.jpg 623w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />hurry sometimes ignore activated warning signals and proceed across railroad tracks. People over 51 years old take more notice of active warning devices than passive ones like signage, and everyone becomes less aware of an oncoming train if they’re talking on a cell phone or listening to music through ear buds when approaching a railroad crossing.</p>
<p>These findings, and many others, were among the conclusions made by researchers who conducted surveys and studied pedestrian and cyclist activity at seven <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/">Chicago Transit Authority</a> (CTA) rapid transit grade crossings in metropolitan Chicago.  The objective of the study was to contribute to the still limited research on pedestrian and cyclist safety at rail grade crossings and expand the scope of <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/pedestrianbicyclist-warning-devices-and-signs-at-highway-rail-and-pathway-rail-grade-crossings-news-story/">a previous study. </a></p>

<p><strong>Prioritization Framework Proposal to Guide Future IDOT Projects. </strong>One of the key challenges facing states and municipalities is how to prioritize and select future transportation <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3827" src="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Goals-300x146.jpg" alt="Goals" width="300" height="146" srcset="https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Goals-300x146.jpg 300w, https://utc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/Goals.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />improvement or expansion projects.  A new report has proposed a new process designed to provide the <a href="http://www.idot.illinois.gov">Illinois Department of Transportation</a> (IDOT) with a preliminary structure for both long-range planning decisions and project selection. The process would prioritize projects based upon a federal planning framework style called <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/performance_based_planning/">Performance-Based Planning and Programming</a> and allows for flexibility so it can be applied to any future transportation project.</p>
<p>If applied, the proposed UTC Framework would be used by IDOT to initially establish long-range transportation goals and policies and then set priorities for projects through input from local jurisdictions.  Next, the department would develop procedures to rank and score projects; the ranked projects would later be reviewed by an IDOT panel for potential funding. <a href="https://utc.uic.edu/prioritization-framework-proposal-designed-to-help-idot-apply-systematic-and-flexible-guidelines-to-new-transportation-projects-news-story/">Read a news story and get access to the report</a>, which was managed by UTC Research Assistant Professor <strong>Dr. Robert E.

A recent UTC research report, &#8220;Developing Performance Measures for the Illinois Maritime Freight Transportation System,&#8221; provides key recommendations for creating the framework needed by Illinois to better utilize commercial waterways.</p>
<p>An improved system for moving freight through Illinois waterways can provide jobs and other economic benefits and help ease congestion on state highways. Plus, development of performance measures is essential to the federal government’s Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) surface transportation bill.
