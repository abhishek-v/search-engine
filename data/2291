This could be useful for having students <strong>label vocabulary</strong>, <strong>write an imaginary dialogue</strong> based on visual clues, or <strong>create a description of an image</strong>. Because it&#8217;s so quick and easy to use, it would also make a great tool for <strong>creating visuals for in-class use</strong>.</p>
<p>Images can be uploaded from your computer or Facebook, or you can opt for a random stock photo. Phrase.it creations can be either downloaded or shared via a link.  No account is required and your images can be saved as unlisted so they&#8217;re only available through a direct link, making it a safer choice for classroom use than Snapchat.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Recap</strong> (<a href="https://letsrecap.com/" target="_blank">https://letsrecap.com/</a>) is a free web- and mobile-based tool that allows teachers to <strong>easily collect video responses</strong> from students. <span class="il">With</span> Recap, you simply ask a question (or several questions) via text or video, select a time limit for the response video (up to 2 minutes), and assign it to your class. Students join your class via a PIN and can sign in <span class="il">with</span> Google. Students <strong>record their video directly in Recap</strong> (using a webcam or mobile device) and it’s automatically added to your class dashboard for your review. When you give feedback, students are notified automatically by email.</p>
<p>You can also add a <strong>self-assessment</strong> at the end of your Recap assignment for students to tell you how they think they did. This makes it a great tool for <strong>checking student pronunciation, vocabulary, and general speaking ability</strong>. Other possible instructional uses might include collecting student responses to course material like readings and videos, or having students explain new grammatical concepts (in English) in their own terms to demonstrate comprehension.</p>
<p>Because Recap <strong>focuses on speaking and not writing</strong>, it can be a great tool for helping students who may have trouble <span class="il">with</span> spelling and written grammar feel <strong>more confident</strong> expressing themselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While many of our students are “digital natives,” research shows that they often don’t know how to use the <span class="il">technology</span> we work <span class="il">with</span> in <span class="il">teaching</span>. <strong>Things like Blackboard, Voiceboard, Wikis, Discussion Boards, online tests, and other tools that we’ve learned to use and integrate into our courses, often pose a steep learning curve for students</strong>. Other aspects of everyday technologies also pose a challenge: both checking and composing emails is often something students seem to struggle <span class="il">with</span>.</p>
<p>Student difficulty in using tech is frustrating, both for them and for us. Help alleviate this frustration by <strong><span class="il">teaching</span> them to work <span class="il">with</span> the <span class="il">technology</span> you expect them to use</strong>. Before your first tech assignment, create a <strong>low-stakes/no-stakes assignment</strong> using the same tools so they can work out all the kinks before it really matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a practice Voiceboard where students just say their name. Make them play it back and check that everything worked, then answer a one question quiz to verify they’ve done it.</li>
<li>Create a practice blog where students post the poster and IMDb link of their favorite film.</li>
<li>Create a practice test on a commonly-known or easy-to-Google topic (Chicago facts, the UIC campus, etc.) that uses all the question types you expect students to see.</li>
<li>Have students watch a short Sharestream video (like a TV commercial) and take a short quiz or write a brief summary.</li>
</ul>
<p>To encourage students to complete these practice assignments, grade them for completeness or the attempt, count them as participation, or give bonus points.</p>
