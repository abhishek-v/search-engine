    <td height="310" colspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify"><b>Mitra Dutta </b> is currently a UIC Distinguished Professor and the Head of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Her research has focused on electronic and optoelectronic devices as well as the physics of these materials and device structures. After her Ph.D. from University of Cincinnati (1981) and postdoctoral appointments at Purdue University (1981-1983), City College of New York (1983-1986), and Visiting Researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory (1984-1986), Dr. Dutta joined the US Army Research Laboratory (then called Electronics Technology and Devices Laboratory - ETDL) first as Team Leader of the Optoelectronics Team, then as Branch Chief and finally as Division Director of the Physics Division supervising and managing a large group of scientists and engineers. In 1996 she moved to the US Army Research Office (ARO) where after a short time as a program manager for quantum electronics, she ran the Electronics Division.In 1999 she was promoted to the Senior Executive Service as Director of the Research Technology and Integration Directorate, having oversight over the $310M ARO budget. Dr. Dutta has held adjunct professor positions at Rutgers University, University of Maryland, North Carolina State University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She has authored or co-authored over 400 publications and presentations, holds 31 US and Canadian patents, has co-edited five books and is a co-author on a sixth. She served on the Army Science and Technology committee for Homeland Security, and coauthored the NRC Reports 1 and 2 for the Board for Army Science and Technology. </p>
